A simple method to enable my AdGuard server on your computer.

# What is AdGuard?
AdGuard (Home) is a free DNS adblocking service, which allows you to block adverts from the DNS level. The script in this repository is preconfigured with my personal AdGuard server, so you don't need to self host it!

For noobs: AdGuard (Home) allows you to easily get rid of adverts through custom internet servers. This tool means you don't need to have your own server with AdGuard!

# Usage
Currently, we only have Windows support.

1. Right-click this link and select 'Save link as...'. Save it somewhere and make sure it is a '.ps1' file at the end.
2. Find the file which you just downloaded. Now, right-click it and follow through the steps. Each step will tell you what they do.

- The first step checks whether the server is running.
- The second step sets up Cloudflare alongside AdGuard (if the AdGuard server goes down, your internet will continue working but with ads).
